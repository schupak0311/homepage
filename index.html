                  <p>Started Trump University with Michael Sexton and Jonathan Spitalny: no grades, certificates and
                    other bureaucracy, but program offered courses in real estate, asset management entrepreneurship,
                    and wealth creation. 98% students gave positive reviews while studying, however some of these
                    ungrateful gringos filed lawsuits against Trump University after the course. I had to pay $25
                    million to settle that...</p>

                  <p>Acquired the former Hotel Delmonico, which was renovated and reopened in 2004 as the Trump Park
                    Avenue. I sure do like my surname!</p>

                  <p><small>1999</small></p>
                  <p>Started buying golf courses. They are very cheap, I have 18 of them now in USA and abroad! Also
                    switched to the Reform Party that year</p>

                  <p><small>1997</small></p>
                  <p>Began a multi-building development along the Hudson River, which was named Trump Place. Me and the
                    other investors sold our shares for $1.8 billion and that was then the biggest residential sale in
                    the history of New York City</p>

                <li>

                  <p>Acquired the Bank of Manhattan Trust Building, which was a vacant seventy-one story skyscraper on
                    Wall Street. After an extensive renovation, the high-rise was renamed the Trump Building</p>

                  <p><small>1994</small></p>
                  <p>Refurbished the Gulf and Western Building on Columbus Circle, turned it into a 44-story luxury
                    property known as Trump International Hotel and Tower</p>

                  <p>Ran a second hand airline called Trump Shuttle. What a waste of money, I had to sell it, now it is
                    American Airlines Shuttle, btw</p>

                  <p>Learned about Tour de France and decided to hold my very own Tour de Trump. Is America not great

                <li>
                  <p><small>1988</small></p>
                  <p>Acquired the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan for $407 million, invested $50 million to restore the
                    building and boosted it from three-star to four-star hotel (I called it "the Mona Lisa" and sold it
                    for a lot of cash in 1995)</p>

                  <p>I bought the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach and turned it into a private club.You can join if you
                    pay $200K initiation fee (and there is another annual fee for members, it is very expensive to be
                    rich). That year I also opened a casino called Trump Castle. My wife Ivana became a manager, because
                    she is another Trump!</p>

                  <p><small>1983</small></p>
                  <p>I purchased New Jersey Generals, an American football team. I changed team's play schedule and
                    filed an antitrust lawsuit against United States Football League, so NJG are not doing so good now,
                    but back then they were great!</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><small>1980</small></p>
                  <p>Started developing the Trump Tower skyscraper in Manhattan, I payed a crew of undocumented Polish
                    workers to demolish the historic Bonwit Teller store, including art deco features. All this to make
                    architectural critic Paul Goldberger say in 1983 that the tower's atrium is "the most pleasant
                    interior public space to be completed in New York in some years". At the same time I also started a
                    repair job on the Wollman Rink in Central Park and completed the work in three months for $1.95
                    million, which was $775,000 less than the initial budget!</p>
